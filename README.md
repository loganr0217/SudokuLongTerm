# SudokuLongTerm
This project analyzes the differences between optimizations to a backtracking algorithm used to solve Sudoku puzzles. There are three different "versions" or "implementations. The three implementations each use a different sequence of numbers. When the program reaches an open square, it "guesses" values based on the order of the sequence.

Sequential Guessing: uses the sequence 1, 2, ... 9 

Random Guessing: uses a randomized sequence consisting of the numbers 1, 2, ... 9

Frequency-Based Guessing: uses a sequence consisting of the numbers 1, 2, ... 9 ordered by the frequency of the numbers in the puzzle (least frequent ... most frequent)
